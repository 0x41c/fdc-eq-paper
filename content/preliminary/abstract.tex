  We rediscover Taylor's definition of the finite difference operation and then prove the equivalence of this definition to the operation's standard definition. The implication of approximation to the derivative is more explicit, and as a result, direct claims made of approximation-related properties of the finite difference operation can be proven with greater ease.
